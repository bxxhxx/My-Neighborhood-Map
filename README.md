## About "My Neighborhood Map"
This application requests a list of more than 2200 stars on the "Hollywood Walk of Fame," using Wikipedia API.
Then it sorts the data into a large array, which is used by the Knockout ViewModel.
This info is accessible to users, either through the clickable "category" filter, or through a "live search" box that lets users search for individual star names.
Users can click either a star's name, or the star marker on the map, to reveal the exact address of the star, and get a link to an article on Wikipedia.
Index.html uses "minified" (.min) versions of CSS and Javascript. The standard versions of these files, with notes, are included in the directory for review.
